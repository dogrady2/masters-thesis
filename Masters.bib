	abstract = {In the case of nuclear energy, fuel costs represent a small fraction of the electricity generating cost, especially compared to fossile sources. [...]operating at higher load factors is profitable for nuclear power plants as they cannot make savings on fuel costs while not producing electricity. In France, the impact of load-following on the average unit capacity factor is sometimes estimated at about 1.2\%. Since most of the currently used nuclear power plants have strong manoeuvrability capabilities in their designs (except for some very old {NPPs}), there is no or limited impact (within the design margins) of load-following on the acceleration of ageing of large equipment components.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the impact of renewable energies, wind and photovoltaic, on the formation of day-ahead electricity prices at {EEX}. We give an overview of the policy decisions concerning the promotion of renewable energy sources in Germany and discuss their consequences on day-ahead prices. An analysis of electricity spot prices reveals that the introduction of renewable energies enhances extreme price changes. In the frame of a dynamic fundamental model, we show that there has been a continuous electricity price adaption process to market fundamentals. Furthermore, the fundamental drivers of prices differ among hours with different load profiles. Our results imply that renewable energies decrease market spot prices and have implications on the traditional fuel mix for electricity production. However, the prices for the final consumers increased overall because they must pay in addition the feed-in tariffs for the promotion of renewable energy.},
